NEST Extension Module Example
=============================

This repository contains an example extension module (i.e a "plugin") for
the `NEST Simulator <https://nest-simulator.org>`_. Extension modules allow
users to extend the functionality of NEST without altering the source
code of NEST itself, thus making pulls from upstream easy, while allowing
to extend NEST and sharing the extensions with other researchers.

For the full documentation of this feature and further instructions, please see
https://nest-extension-module.readthedocs.io/.

.. attention::

   Please note that the code in this repository is compatible with the latest
   NEST version only; in particular the git "master" branch on
   https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator. For 2.x versions of NEST, see the
   extension module example in ``examples/MyModule`` of the source distribution.
