# NEST Extension Module for `<<MODULE_NAME>>`

This is just a stand-in for a proper README.md of your extension
module. Please adapt and extend according to your needs.

## Instructions

To turn this minimal extension module example into a working one, run
`initialize.py` with the module name as argument and do something
reasonable for all code locations marked by `NOTE:`. You can find all
relevant code lines using `grep -r 'NOTE:'` in the top level source
directory.

For a fully functional example extension module and a more thorough
explanation of how to write your own, please visit the master branch
of the repository at https://github.com/nest/nest-extension-module.
